- integrate pomodoro to bufferline
- better mapping management
- config treesitter
- change colors name, project wise (*sigh*)
- get rid of nvchad "extension" package at some point
- better "file written" message

- use telescope instead of qf menu for code actions
- man & cppman open in floating window, with K
- diagnostic curly underline
- better find word in telescope
