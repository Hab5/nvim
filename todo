- change fg of matching scope token instead of bg
- add border to signature popup thingy
- better git signs color
- set floating window with curved border
- change paragraph to language specific block ? (maybe treesitter can do that)

- add toggleterms with commands (gdb/lazygit/ranger etc) (and create a picker in telescope) +bindings

- add new telescope bindings
- improve colon commands prompt/completion (ideally with something like ivy, maybe Telescope ?)
- telescope scroll preview with mouse, use to work, why did it stop?
- comment with slash in cpp
